Max Bricks is a pedagogical package for Max with the aim to help new Max users who are familiar with DAW environments like Ableton become more comfortable working within a visual programming environment. To do this, Max Bricks contains a suite of bpatcher modules that both feel more like a plugin in a DAW while teaching basic concepts of electronic music to students. This approach is not dissimilar to other Max packages like BEAP, but it is specifically aimed to allows users to write musically fulfilling works while learning Max.
